# What is Velocity?
Velocity is the modern, high-performance proxy, in every sense. Boasting unparalleled speed and next-level design, it’s a full alternative to Waterfall/Bungeecord with its own plugin ecosystem.

# Why Velocity?
## Out with the old, in with the new.
Velocity is the very best proxy software available. Boasting much expanded capabilities due to next-level technical design, it runs laps around BungeeCord.
## An active and growing community.
Velocity has an active and growing community of server administrators and developers. Got problems? Come talk with Velocity development team on Discord and get real time support.
## Plenty of plugins to choose from.
While BungeeCord has more third-party software due to its longer life so far, Velocity isn’t lacking in the essentials. With enough to get going and more added every day, Velocity’s got what you need.
